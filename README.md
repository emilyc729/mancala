# Mancala
Mancala is one of my favorite childhood games! In this 2 player game, players are each given a side of 6 slots and 1 pot. Each player takes turns picking up marbles from a slot and placing one marble in each slot/pot counter clockwise. If your last marble ends on an empty slot on your side and the slot across is not empty, you get to take the last marble and the marbles in the slot from across into your pot, then your turn ends. If your last marble ends in your pot you may take another turn otherwise, your turn ends if last marble lands on any other slot. Be sure to skip your opponents pot! The game ends when either side of the slots are all empty, and if there are remaining marbles on your side they get added to your pot! The person with the most marbles WINs!
