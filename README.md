# Mancala
Mancala is one of my favorite childhood games! In this game you take turns trying to get the most marbles into your pot.  If your last marble ends on an empty slot on your side, you get to take the marbles in the slot across from it. You may get another turn when your last marble ends in your pot otherwise, your turn ends. The game ends when either side of the slots are all empty, and if there are remaining marbles on your side they get added to your pot! The person with the most marbles WINs!
